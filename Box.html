            <p class="chal1">Electricity consumption is a critical aspect of modern life, powering homes, industries, and technologies. However, this essential resource comes with its set of challenges on the path towards sustainability. Understanding and addressing these challenges is crucial for building a cleaner and greener future.</p>
        
            <article>
                <h3>The Dependence on Non-Renewable Energy Sources</h3>
                <p>One of the primary challenges in achieving sustainable electricity usage is the world's heavy reliance on non-renewable energy sources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These sources contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, leading to climate change and environmental degradation.</p>
                <p>To overcome this challenge, there's a pressing need to transition towards cleaner and renewable alternatives like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. This shift requires substantial investments in infrastructure, technology, and policy frameworks to support the widespread adoption of renewable energy.</p>

                <h3>Carbon Emissions from Traditional Power Plants</h3>
                <p>Traditional power plants, especially those relying on fossil fuels, emit large amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions contribute to air pollution, respiratory problems, and climate change. Finding sustainable alternatives to these power generation methods is paramount for reducing the environmental impact of electricity production.</p>
                <p>The development and implementation of cleaner technologies, carbon capture and storage, and increased energy efficiency measures are essential steps in mitigating the adverse effects of carbon emissions from power plants.</p>

                <h3>Inadequate Infrastructure for Renewable Energy</h3>
                <p>While renewable energy sources hold immense potential, the current infrastructure is often insufficient to harness and distribute their full capacity. Challenges include the intermittent nature of some renewables (like solar and wind) and the need for robust energy storage solutions to address fluctuations in energy production.</p>
                <p>Investments in smart grids, energy storage technologies, and grid modernization are critical for overcoming these infrastructure challenges. Additionally, policies that incentivize the integration of renewable energy into existing grids can accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable electricity system.</p>
